### Other relevant softwares

- [Easybuild](https://github.com/apaam/easy_build): a software environment for easing the configuration, building and installation computational packages. Now support:
  
    - [deal.II](https://github.com/dealii/dealii): a C++ program library targeted at the computational solution of partial differential equations using adaptive finite elements. 
    
    - [liggghts](https://github.com/CFDEMproject/LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC.git): an open source discrete element method particle simulation software that is improved from LAMMPS for general granular and granular heat transfer simulations. This project used a modified [version](https://github.com/schrummy14/LIGGGHTS_Flexible_Fibers.git) that includes granular bond formulations. 
    
    - [netdem](https://github.com/apaam/netdem.git): a neural network machine learning enabled DEM framework for computational particle mechanics. [to be open-source soon]
    
    - [openfoam](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-dev): a free, open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package released by the OpenFOAM Foundation.
    
    - [peridigm](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm.git): an open-source computational peridynamics code developed, originally at Sandia National Laboratories and open-sourced in 2011, for massively-parallel multi-physics simulations.
